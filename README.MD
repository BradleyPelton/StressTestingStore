NAME OF THE GAME: Performance Testing, Load Testing, API TESTING

Great skills I'm going to learn along the way:
- Load testing
- CONCURRENCY
- REQUESTS LIBRARY(python main lib)
- BENCHMARKING
- HTTP PROXY
- Simultaneous web and mobile user load testing 
- GOOD TIME TO LEARN K8s/DOCKER FOR LINUX
- WEBSOCKET TESTING IS ABOUT AS COMPELX AS IT GETS. CUSTOM CLIENT NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN.

WHY NOT JMETER?
- "JMeter is thread-bound. This means for every user you want to simulate, you need a separate
thread. Needless to say, benchmarking thousands of users on a single machine just isn’t feasible."
- Jmeter requires Java or Jython
